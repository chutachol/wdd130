            <p>My name is Chut Achol Matet, and I am a student at BYU Ensign College currently pursuing my first
                certificate
                in web
                development. I come from South Sudan, the youngest country in the world, and my background has shaped me
                into someone
                who values resilience, growth, and opportunity. My journey to college has been filled with challenges,
                but
                each step has
                strengthened my determination to succeed and contribute meaningfully to the world around me.

                At Ensign College, I have discovered a passion for coding and digital creativity. Web development allows
                me
                to combine
                logic and design in a way that brings ideas to life. I enjoy the process of building websites that are
                not
                only
                functional but also visually engaging. Every project I work on is a chance to learn something new and
                sharpen my skills.
                I believe that technology can be a powerful tool for change, and I am excited to use it to uplift
                communities—especially
                in South Sudan and across Africa.

                Beyond academics, I am someone who values connection, culture, and faith. I love exploring new ideas,
                learning from
                others, and staying grounded in my beliefs. My goal is to become a frontend developer who builds tools
                and
                platforms
                that help businesses grow and people thrive. I am proud of where I come from, and I am inspired by where
                I
                am going. This
                is just the beginning of my journey, and I am ready to embrace every opportunity that comes my way</p>
